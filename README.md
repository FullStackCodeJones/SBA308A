## What It Is

Welcome to the **GIF Messaging App**—the easiest way to send loving messages and funny GIFs to your loved ones. This app was made with **love** and **GIFs** (obviously), and it's perfect for when you want to send a message with that little extra *something*. Think hugs, laughs, and good vibes all wrapped up in a shiny GIF.

**Features:**
- Search for GIFs (any word or phrase you want!).
- Click to select the perfect one.
- Write your personal message.
- Send it! (Currently logs it to the console—but stay tuned, I’m working on real messages).

## How to Use It

1. **Find Your GIF:** Type a word in the search bar like "love," "goodbye," or "funny," and click the "Find GIFs" button.
2. **Pick the GIF:** Click on a GIF to select it. It'll show up in the selected area.
3. **Write Your Message:** Type your heartfelt (or hilarious) message in the input box.
4. **Send It:** Once everything’s perfect, hit "Send" to share the love. **Note:** It’s all saved in the backend for now.
